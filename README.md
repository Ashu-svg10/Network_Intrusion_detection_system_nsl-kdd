# Network_Intrusion_detection_system-nsl-kdd-
This project builds a Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System using the NSL-KDD dataset. We preprocess data through encoding and scaling, train multiple ML models, and compare their performance. SMOTE will be applied later to improve detection of minority attack classes.
